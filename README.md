## Lynk

Lynk is a minimal, privacy-focused app that makes it easy to save and share text and URLs. Whether you're collecting notes, saving important links, or quickly sharing something with a friend, we keep everything in your iCloud.

🔐 Everything stays on your iCloud

⏰ Get reminded to get back to that article you set for later

🚫 No accounts, no tracking, no ads

⚡️ Fast, clean, and distraction-free

💻 Open Source

**Your links. Your notes. Your privacy. That’s Lynk.**
